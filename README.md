# todo
A to-do list web app that can handle custom lists and stores them in a MongoDB 

When you open the app to the home route it will load your "Home" list and the three default items describe how it functions.
In the address bar you can create new, customized routes by simply typing the name of the list you wish to create after the "/" and it will create a list with that name.
You can add new to-do items to the list and can also check items off as you complete them.
